# Production Problem 9: A/B Testing on the Cheap

## The Problem

Locate an interface component on some website that you use frequently that you think could be improved. The improvement should be minor, as we discussed in class.

Take a screenshot of the interface on both a mobile and desktop device. Then, sketch or illustrate your alternate/"b" test. Finally, describe modification and the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that you would need to write in order to conduct the test.

## Deliverables

* Screenshots of the interface component on mobile and desktop, placed in this directory (`week-15`)
Done

* Sketch or illustrate (e.g., in Photoshop) your alternate/"b" test, placed in this directory (`week-15`)
Done

* A text description of the modification, and a description of the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that you would need to write for the test (you do *not* have to write the actual HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, however)
The original site is written to 1999 HTML spec, and should be brought into HTML5. This will require removing all the formatting done in HTML with <br> and <hl> tags, and porting it to CSS.

Additionally, the CSS should be broken out into its own file, and the HTML should be updated to use semantic tags for readability.

Lastly, Media queries and relative units can be used to make content resize to the screen, before improving the color scheme.
