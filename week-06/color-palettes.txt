# Production Problem 4: Color Palettes for HCI

## The Problem

Using either Adobe Color CC (https://color.adobe.com/), Paletton (http://paletton.com/), or another
Web-based palette generator of your choosing, you will create a number of different color palettes,
based on the requirements in the Deliverables section below.

## Deliverables

Fine-grained, atomic commits to your Production Problems repository that include:

1) screenshots of your web-based palette for the four palettes below;
2) an explanation, after each palette request below, why you chose the colors you did

* A monochromatic palette for a website that creates high-end, custom-made gaming laptops.

Explanation of your color choices: Because of Hollywood's influence, people conflate black or dark
green with bright green as "1337," or cool and vaguely hacker-y or hardcore. Think: Matrix.

* A shaded color palette for a website that sells natural and organic foods.

Explanation of your color choices: Normally, I'd've chosen green, because of its association with 
vegetables. However, I already chose green for the laptop website, and wanted to challenge myself to 
pick a different but applicable pallet. Let's face it, a lot of the marketing around Organic centers 
around image. Where do people care about image? Social media. What colors are similar to the ones I 
chose? The colors used by Tumblr and Facebook. This might serve to subliminially tell customers to share
their brand on their favorite social media, and may be reminiscent of "superfoods" like blueberries.

* A complementary palette for a banking website.

Filename: Complementary.png
Explanation of your color choices: I chose to include green because of its general association with cash.
Gold would've also been an acceptable choice, but is a bit brighter and more tiring on the eyes than
I had intended on going with. A deep burgundy red rather than reddish-purple looked better to me as a
complementary color, and resulted in a closer shade of green to what I was going for.

* A triadic palette for a website that offers games for children.
