# Production Problem 7: Usability Checklists

## The Problem

Usability checklists are typical, and sometimes mindless, tools/magic tricks used to find usability problems in web and other digital projects. What you are going to do for this Production Problem is to locate at least 2 different usability checklists of at least 25 items (use Google, but challenge yourself to go beyond the first page of results). From those lists, create your own, condensed list of exactly ten items. Share with your group for Project 3 to help yourselves create your own master usability checklist.

## Deliverables

* URLs for the usability checklists you've found:

1. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Accessibility/What_needs_to_be_done_when_building_new_toolkits
2. https://stayintech.com/info/UX

* Your own condensed, ten-item must-have usability checklist:

0. CONSISTENCY. This bears being rule 0.
1. Custom 404/500 error pages that are useful and direct.
2. Buttons, forms, etc rather than links. Links are descriptive, not just "click here"
3. Dialogs/Windows/General keyboard input is standards compliant. (e.g. esc closes things and refocuses parent window)
4. Does not conflict with system-set contrast/accessibility/theme settings (dark theme in gtk is a good litmus test)
5. SSL certificate
6. User testing from http://peek.usertesting.com/ (free and not someone involved with the development of it)
7. Make sure the user knows where they are, perhaps breadcrumbs?
8. Avoid A-Z sorting if any better system works

9. Emphasis such as bold and underline are to be used sparingly.
10. URLs are to be meaningful, human readable. This should honestly be higher up the list.
